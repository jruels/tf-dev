   ```powershell
   Get-ExecutionPolicy
   ```
2. If the policy is not `AllSigned` or `Bypass`, set it to `Bypass` temporarily:

   ```
2. Wait for the script to complete. Chocolatey will be installed on your system.

---

### **Step 5: Verify the Installation**
1. Test that Chocolatey is installed by running:
   ```powershell
   choco --version
   ```
   - This should display the installed version of Chocolatey.

### **Step 6: Use Chocolatey to install needed packages**
1. Install some required packages:
   ```powershell
   choco install git wget awscli terraform -y
   ```

### **Important Note:**
Always remember to run VS Code in **Administrator mode** whenever you need to use Chocolatey for installing or managing software that requires system-level changes.
